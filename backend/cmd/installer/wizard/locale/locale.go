• Poor conversation flow: Increase context retention for quality
• Different model types: Short-context vs long-context model tuning

General Summarization: Maximum cost control and precision tuning for research/analysis tasks
Assistant Summarization: Optimal conversation quality with intelligent context management for interactive sessions

Quick wins:
• Cost reduction: Use General, reduce Recent Sections to 1-2
• Context errors: Match limits to your model (8K/32K/128K)

• Better performance on GPT-3.5, Claude Instant, smaller models

• Size Management OFF: 2-3x larger context (less compression)
• Section/Response Limits: Control individual component sizes
• QA Memory: Manages total conversation history when limits exceeded

Parameter interactions:
• QA compression activates when BOTH MaxQABytes AND MaxQASections exceeded
• Size Management disabled → sections can grow 2x larger than limits

Adjustments by model type:
• Short context (≤16K): Recent Sections=1-2, Section Limit=45KB
• Long context (128K+): Can increase Recent Sections=5-7
• High-frequency chat: Reduce Recent Sections=2 for faster responses

Advanced tuning:
• QA Memory 200KB+ for document analysis conversations
• Response Limit 24-32KB for detailed technical responses
• Keep User Messages uncompressed (SummHumanInQA=false) for better context

Performance optimization:
• Each Recent Section ≈ 9-18KB in assistant mode

Basic setup requires enabling capabilities: Docker Access allows spawning additional containers for specialized tools, while Network Admin grants low-level network permissions essential for scanning tools like nmap.

Storage operates via Docker volumes by default, or host directories when Work Directory is specified. Connection settings control the Docker daemon location - local socket for standard setups, or remote TCP with TLS for distributed environments.

Default images serve as fallbacks: general tasks use standard images, while security testing defaults to pentesting-focused containers. Public IP enables reverse shell attacks by providing workers with a reachable address for target callbacks. Usually it's a local interface address of the host machine with Docker daemon running for the workers containers.
