# PentAGI End User License Agreement

## Introduction

This **End User License Agreement (EULA)** governs the terms and conditions for the use of PentAGI, an advanced AI-powered penetration testing tool. This product is provided by the **PentAGI Development Team**, and is distributed in the form of [source code](https://github.com/vxcontrol/pentagi) available on GitHub under the MIT license as well as [pre-built Docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/vxcontrol/pentagi) available on Docker Hub.

Users agree to this EULA when downloading either the source code or the Docker images or by accessing the product's interface through its web UI. It is the user's responsibility to ensure compliance with all applicable laws and standards when utilizing PentAGI. This product is intended for lawful penetration testing purposes and research purposes only and does not inherently possess tools used for executing cyber attacks. Instead, it facilitates the download of publicly available penetration testing tools such as those from Kali Linux or other similar distributions.

PentAGI operates independently of services provided by the Developers and allows users to self-deploy all components. Users initiate interaction through a web user interface, which is part of the product itself. Integration with external LLM providers and search systems requires careful oversight by the user to ensure data compliance, including regulations like GDPR.

The **PentAGI Development Team** can be contacted via GitHub or through the email address [info@pentagi.com](mailto:info@pentagi.com). This document should be reviewed in its entirety to fully understand the terms and legal obligations therein.

## License Grant

Under this EULA, the **PentAGI Development Team** grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the PentAGI software solely for lawful penetration testing purposes. This license is effective when you download the source code or Docker images and remains in effect until terminated as outlined in this agreement.

The source code of PentAGI is provided under the MIT license, the terms of which are incorporated herein by reference. This EULA governs your use of the PentAGI software as a whole, including any pre-built Docker images and the web UI, and applies in addition to the MIT license. In the event of any conflict between this EULA and the MIT license, the terms of the MIT license shall prevail with respect to the source code.

You are permitted to use the PentAGI software on your own infrastructure, self-deploying all components according to provided documentation. The license covers usage as allowed by the MIT license under which the source code is distributed, but does not extend to any proprietary tools that may be downloaded or used in conjunction with the PentAGI software.

You may not sublicense, sell, lease, or distribute the PentAGI software or its derivatives in any form other than stated in the license agreement. Modification and redistribution are permitted under the MIT license conditions; however, the **PentAGI Development Team** holds no responsibility for any alterations not published by them through the official GitHub or Docker Hub pages.

## Acceptable Use

PentAGI is to be used exclusively for authorized penetration testing and security assessments in environments where you have explicit permission from the network owner. You must ensure that all usage complies with applicable laws, standards, and regulations, particularly those concerning cybersecurity and data protection.

You are solely responsible for the execution and outcomes of any tasks set for AI agents within the PentAGI interface. The logic and actions of the AI agents are strictly determined by the tasks and instructions you provide. The **PentAGI Development Team** does not supervise or control the actions of the AI agents and is not responsible for any consequences arising from their actions. You must verify that all data sent to AI agents, external LLM providers, search systems, or stored within PentAGI complies with legal standards and regulations, including but not limited to GDPR.

You must not use PentAGI in any critical infrastructure, emergency response systems, or other high-risk environments without proper testing and validation. The software is intended for research and testing purposes only and should not be deployed in production environments without thorough security assessment.

Using PentAGI for any activity that violates laws or regulations, including but not limited to unauthorized network access, is strictly prohibited. Users found using the software for illegal purposes may have their license revoked and could face further legal consequences, as determined by law enforcement.

## Data Privacy and Security

You acknowledge that PentAGI may process sensitive information during penetration testing activities. You are solely responsible for ensuring that all data processing complies with applicable privacy laws and regulations, including GDPR, CCPA, and other relevant data protection regulations.

The **PentAGI Development Team** does not collect, store, or process any user data through the software. All data processing occurs locally within your infrastructure or through third-party services that you configure. You are responsible for implementing appropriate security measures to protect any sensitive data processed through PentAGI.

When using PentAGI's integration capabilities with external services, you must ensure that all data transfers comply with applicable data protection regulations and that you have obtained necessary consents for data processing.

## Third-Party Services

PentAGI integrates with external third-party services, including but not limited to Large Language Model (LLM) providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic, Depp Infra, OpenRouter, and search engines such as Tavily, Traversal, Perplexity, DuckDuckGo and Google. You acknowledge and agree that your use of these third-party services is at your sole discretion and responsibility.

When using self-hosted or local LLM servers compatible with OpenAI API, you are solely responsible for ensuring the security and compliance of these deployments. The PentAGI Development Team bears no responsibility for any data leaks or security issues arising from the use of such local deployments.
